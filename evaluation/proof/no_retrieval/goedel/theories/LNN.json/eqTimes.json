Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (T : System) (a b c d : Term), SysPrf T (equal a b) -> SysPrf T (equal c d) -> SysPrf T (equal (Times a c) (Times b d))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros T a b c d H1 H2.\napply SysPrfRule with (Gamma := T) (phi := equal a b) (psi := equal c d).\n- assumption.\n- assumption.\nQed.\n```"}], "original": "intros T a b c d H1 H2. apply SysPrfRule with (Gamma := T) (phi := equal a b) (psi := equal c d). - auto. - auto.", "succ": false}]
