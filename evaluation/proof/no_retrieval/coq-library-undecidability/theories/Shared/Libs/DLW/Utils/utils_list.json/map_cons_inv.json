Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nY: Type\nX: Type\nf: X -> Y\nll: list X\ny: Y\nm: list Y\n\nGoal:\nmap f ll = y :: m -> {x : X & {l : list X | ll = x :: l /\\ f x = y /\\ map f l = m}}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros. destruct ll as [| x l] eqn: Hll.\n- discriminate.\n- injection 1 as H1 H2. exists x, l. split. reflexivity. split. congruence. exact H2.\nQed.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros. destruct ll as [| x l] eqn: Hll. - discriminate. - injection 1 as H1 H2. exists x, l. split. reflexivity. split. congruence. apply H2.", "succ": true}]
