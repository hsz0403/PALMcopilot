Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nA: Type\nf: A -> nat\n\nGoal:\nforall (l : list (btree A)) (t1 t2 : btree A), build l t1 -> build l t2 -> weight_tree f t1 = weight_tree f t2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros l t1 t2 H1 H2.\nunfold weight_tree.\nrewrite H1. rewrite H2. reflexivity.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros l t1 t2 H1 H2. unfold weight_tree. rewrite H1. rewrite H2. reflexivity.", "succ": true}]
