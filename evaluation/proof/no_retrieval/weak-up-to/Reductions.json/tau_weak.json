Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nA: Type\nX: Type\nRed: reduction_t X\n\nGoal:\nforall (y : X) (l : Lbl) (x z : X), Red T x y -> Weak l y z -> Weak l x z"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros y l x z H1 H2. intros H3. apply Weak_trans with y.\n- apply Weak_reduction with x; assumption.\n- assumption.\nQed.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros y l x z H1 H2. intros H3. apply Weak_trans with y. - apply Weak_reduction with x; auto. - auto.", "succ": true}]
