Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (d : preDTA) (a : ad) (s : state), MapGet state d a = Some s -> coacc_transitive_def d a a"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hypotheses:\n  d : preDTA\n  a : ad\n  s : state\n  H : MapGet state d a = Some s\n\nGoal:\n  coacc_transitive_def d a a\n```coq\nunfold coacc_transitive_def. rewrite H. intros _. exists s. reflexivity.\nQed.```"}], "original": "unfold coacc_transitive_def. rewrite H. intros _. exists s. reflexivity.", "succ": true}]
