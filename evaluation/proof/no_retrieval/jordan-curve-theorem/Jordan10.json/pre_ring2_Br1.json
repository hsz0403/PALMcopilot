Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (m : fmap) (l : list), inv_hmap m -> planar m -> double_link_list m l -> pre_ring0 m l -> pre_ring1 m l -> pre_ring2 m l -> let (x, x') := first l in let y := cA m zero x in let y' := cA m zero x' in ~ expf m y y' -> pre_ring2 (Br1 m x x') (tail l)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros m l H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6.\ndestruct (first l) as [x x'] eqn:Hfirst.\ndestruct (cA m zero x) as y eqn:HcA1.\ndestruct (cA m zero x') as y' eqn:HcA2.\nintros H7.\nunfold pre_ring2 in *.\nsimpl.\nunfold pre_ring2 in H6.\nrewrite Hfirst in H6.\nsimpl in H6.\ndestruct l.\n- simpl in H6. contradiction.\n- simpl in H6.\n  apply H6.\nQed.\nQed.\n```"}], "original": "intros m l H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6. destruct (first l) as [x x'] eqn:Hfirst. destruct (cA m zero x) as y eqn:HcA1. destruct (cA m zero x') as y' eqn:HcA2. intros H7. unfold pre_ring2 in *. simpl. unfold pre_ring2 in H6. rewrite Hfirst in H6. simpl in H6. destruct l. - simpl in H6. contradiction. - simpl in H6. apply H6.", "succ": false}]
