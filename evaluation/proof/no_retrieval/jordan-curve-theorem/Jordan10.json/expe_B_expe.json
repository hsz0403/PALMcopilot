Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (m : fmap) (x z t : dart), inv_hmap m -> expe (B m zero x) z t -> expe m z t"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros m x z t Hmap Hexpe.\nunfold expe in *. destruct Hexpe as [Hadj [Hadj' [Hneq Heq]]].\nsplit.\n- split; try assumption. \n  apply expv_B; assumption.\n- split; try assumption.\nQed.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros m x z t Hmap Hexpe. unfold expe in *. destruct Hexpe as [Hadj [Hadj' [Hneq Heq]]]. split. - split; try auto. apply expv_B; auto. - split; try auto.", "succ": false}]
