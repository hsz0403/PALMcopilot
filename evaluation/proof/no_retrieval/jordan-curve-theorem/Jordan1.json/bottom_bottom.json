Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (m : fmap) (k : dim) (z : dart), inv_hmap m -> bottom m k (bottom m k z) = bottom m k z"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros m k z H. unfold bottom. destruct H as [Hnodup _]. rewrite Hnodup. reflexivity.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros m k z H. unfold bottom. destruct H as [Hnodup _]. rewrite Hnodup. reflexivity.", "succ": false}]
