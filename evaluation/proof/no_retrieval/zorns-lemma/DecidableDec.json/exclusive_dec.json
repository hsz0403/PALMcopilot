Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall P Q : Prop, ~ (P /\\ Q) -> P \\/ Q -> {P} + {Q}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros P Q H1 H2.\ndestruct H2 as [HP | HQ].\n- right. exact HP.\n- left. contradict H1. split; assumption.\nQed.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros P Q H1 H2. destruct H2 as [HP | HQ]. - right. apply HP. - left. contradict H1. split; auto.", "succ": false}]
