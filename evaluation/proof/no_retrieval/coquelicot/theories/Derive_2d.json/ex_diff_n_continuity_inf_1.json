Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall n p k : nat, (p + k < n)%nat -> forall (f : R -> R -> R) (x y : R), ex_diff_n f n x y -> continuity_2d_pt (fun u v : R => Derive (fun z : R => partial_derive p k f z v) u) x y"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros n p k H f x y H0.\napply continuity_partial_derive with (m := n). \napply ex_diff_derive; apply H0.\nQed.\nQed.\n```"}], "original": "intros n p k H f x y H0. apply continuity_partial_derive with (m := n). apply ex_diff_derive; apply H0.", "succ": false}]
