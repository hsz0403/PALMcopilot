Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nf: R -> R\nb: R\na: R\ndf: R -> R\n\nGoal:\nlet a0 := Rmin a b in let b0 := Rmax a b in (forall x : R, a0 < x < b0 -> is_derive f x (df x)) -> (forall x : R, a0 <= x <= b0 -> continuity_pt f x) -> exists c : R, a0 <= c <= b0 /\\ f b - f a = df c * (b - a)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros a0 b0 H1 H2.\nassert (H3: a0 <= b0) by auto with real.\nassert (H4: continuity_pt f a) by (apply H2; split; auto with real).\nassert (H5: continuity_pt f b) by (apply H2; split; auto with real).\ndestruct (MVT _ _ f df a b a0 b0 H1 H3 H4 H5) as [c [H6 H7]].\nexists c. auto.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros a0 b0 H1 H2. assert (H3: a0 <= b0) by auto with real. assert (H4: continuity_pt f a) by (apply H2; split; auto with real). assert (H5: continuity_pt f b) by (apply H2; split; auto with real). destruct (MVT _ _ f df a b a0 b0 H1 H3 H4 H5) as [c [H6 H7]]. exists c. auto.", "succ": false}]
