Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\ng: R -> R\nf: R -> R\nx: R\n\nGoal:\nex_derive f (g x) -> ex_derive g x -> Derive (fun x : R => f (g x)) x = Derive g x * Derive f (g x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros H1 H2.\nunfold ex_derive, Derive in *. \ndestruct H1 as [f' Hf].\ndestruct H2 as [g' Hg].\nrewrite Hg. rewrite Hf.\nreflexivity.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros H1 H2. unfold ex_derive, Derive in *. destruct H1 as [f' Hf]. destruct H2 as [g' Hg]. rewrite Hg. rewrite Hf. reflexivity.", "succ": false}]
