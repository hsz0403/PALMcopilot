Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (T U : UniformSpace) (f : T -> U) (D : U -> Prop), (forall x : T, D (f x) -> filterlim f (locally x) (locally (f x))) -> open D -> open (fun x : T => D (f x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros T U f D H1 H2 x H3.\napply H2 in H3 as H4.\napply H1 in H4.\nexact H4.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros T U f D H1 H2 x H3. apply H2 in H3 as H4. apply H1 in H4. apply H4.", "succ": true}]
