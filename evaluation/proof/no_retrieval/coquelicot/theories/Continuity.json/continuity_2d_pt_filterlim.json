Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (f : R -> R -> R) (x y : R), continuity_2d_pt f x y <-> filterlim (fun z : R * R => f (fst z) (snd z)) (locally (x, y)) (locally (f x y))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall (f : R -> R -> R) (x y : R), continuity_2d_pt f x y <-> filterlim (fun z : R * R => f (fst z) (snd z)) (locally (x, y)) (locally (f x y))\n\n```coq\nintros f x y. split.\n- intros cont_2d. unfold continuity_2d_pt in cont_2d. unfold filterlim. intros P [eps Heps]. destruct (cont_2d eps Heps) as [delta Hdelta].\n  exists (fun z => fst z = x /\\ snd z = y /\\ snd z = y /\\ Rabs (fst z - x) < delta /\\ Rabs (snd z - y) < delta). split.\n  + unfold within, locally, filtermap. exists delta. split.\n    * apply Hdelta.\n    * intros. destruct H as [[H1 H2] [H3 H4]]. unfold ball in H2, H4. rewrite H1, H3 in H2, H4. simpl in H2, H4. rewrite Rminus_0_r, Rplus_0_r in H2, H4. exact H2.\n  + intros. destruct H as [H1 H2]. apply H1 in H2. destruct H2 as [[H2 H3] [H4 H5]]. unfold within, locally, filtermap in H2. destruct H2 as [d [Hd1 Hd2]].\n    rewrite <- Hd2. apply Heps. exact H3.\n- intros filterlim_f. unfold continuity_2d_pt, filterlim in *. intros eps Heps. unfold locally in filterlim_f.\n  specialize (filterlim_f (fun z => fst z = x /\\ snd z = y /\\ Rabs (fst z - x) < eps /\\ Rabs (snd z - y) < eps) eps).\n  apply filterlim_f. split.\n  + exists eps. split.\n    * apply Heps.\n    * intros. destruct H as [[H1 H2] [H3 H4]]. unfold ball in H2, H4. rewrite H1, H3 in H2, H4. simpl in H2, H4. rewrite Rminus_0_r, Rplus_0_r in H2, H4. exact H2.\n  + intros. destruct H as [H1 H2]. apply H1 in H2. destruct H2 as [[H2 H3] [H4 H5]]. destruct H3 as [H3a H3b]. unfold within in H3a, H3b.\n    unfold ball in H3a, H3b. rewrite Rminus_0_r, Rplus_0_r in H3a, H3b. exact H2.\nQed.\n```"}], "original": "intros f x y. split. - intros cont_2d. unfold continuity_2d_pt in cont_2d. unfold filterlim. intros P [eps Heps]. destruct (cont_2d eps Heps) as [delta Hdelta]. exists (fun z => fst z = x /\\ snd z = y /\\ snd z = y /\\ Rabs (fst z - x) < delta /\\ Rabs (snd z - y) < delta). split. + unfold within, locally, filtermap. exists delta. split. * apply Hdelta. * intros. destruct H as [[H1 H2] [H3 H4]]. unfold ball in H2, H4.", "succ": false}]
