Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nb: nat -> R\na: nat -> R\n\nGoal:\nex_series a -> ex_series b -> Series (fun n : nat => a n + b n) = Series a + Series b"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros a_b_series b_series.\nunfold ex_series in a_b_series, b_series.\ndestruct a_b_series as [M_a H_a].\ndestruct b_series as [M_b H_b].\nsplit.\n- unfold Series.\n  pose (M := Rmax M_a M_b).\n  exists M.\n  intros eps H_eps.\n  assert (eps_2: eps/2 > 0).\n  { lra. }\n  destruct (H_a (eps/2) eps_2) as [N_a HN_a].\n  destruct (H_b (eps/2) eps_2) as [N_b HN_b].\n  pose (N := max N_a N_b).\n  exists N.\n  intros n Hn.\n  specialize (HN_a n).\n  specialize (HN_b n).\n  rewrite <- Rabs_right with (r := a n) in HN_a.\n  rewrite <- Rabs_right with (r := b n) in HN_b.\n  rewrite Rabs_right.\n  rewrite Rabs_right.\n  assert (H_ab: a n + b n - (Series a + Series b) = (a n - Series a) + (b n - Series b)).\n  { ring. }\n  rewrite H_ab.\n  apply Rplus_lt_compat.\n  + apply HN_a. lia.\n  + apply HN_b. lia.\n- apply is_series_plus; assumption.\nQed.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros a_b_series b_series. unfold ex_series in a_b_series, b_series. destruct a_b_series as [M_a H_a]. destruct b_series as [M_b H_b]. split. - unfold Series. pose (M := Rmax M_a M_b). exists M. intros eps H_eps. assert (eps_2: eps/2 > 0). { lra. } destruct (H_a (eps/2) eps_2) as [N_a HN_a]. destruct (H_b (eps/2) eps_2) as [N_b HN_b]. pose (N := max N_a N_b). exists N. intros n Hn. specialize (HN_a n). specialize (HN_b n). rewrite <- Rabs_right with (r := a n) in HN_a. rewrite <- Rabs_right with (r := b n) in HN_b. rewrite Rabs_right. rewrite Rabs_right. assert (H_ab: a n + b n - (Series a + Series b) = (a n - Series a) + (b n - Series b)). { ring. } rewrite H_ab. apply Rplus_lt_compat. + apply HN_a. lia. + apply HN_b. lia. - apply is_series_plus; auto.", "succ": false}]
