Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.```\", without any additional explanation or commentary.

Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\n\n\nGoal:\nforall (A : Type) (P Q R : Ensemble A), Included P Q -> Included Q R -> Included P R"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros A P Q R H1 H2 x H3. apply H1, H2, H3.\nQed.```"}], "original": "intros A P Q R H1 H2 x H3. apply H1, H2, H3.", "succ": true}]
