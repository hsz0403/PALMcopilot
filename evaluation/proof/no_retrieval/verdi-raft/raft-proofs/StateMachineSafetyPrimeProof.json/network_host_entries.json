Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\norig_base_params: BaseParams\none_node_params: OneNodeParams orig_base_params\nraft_params: RaftParams orig_base_params\nrri: raft_refinement_interface\nlci: leader_completeness_interface\naelli: all_entries_leader_logs_interface\nlmi: log_matching_interface\nuii: unique_indices_interface\naerlli: append_entries_leaderLogs_interface\nllsi: leaderLogs_sorted_interface\nlsi: sorted_interface\nllci: leaderLogs_contiguous_interface\nlllmi: leaderLogs_entries_match_interface\nllli: logs_leaderLogs_interface\nollpti: one_leaderLog_per_term_interface\nrlmli: refined_log_matching_lemmas_interface\n\nGoal:\nforall (net : network) (p : packet) (t : term) (n : name) (pli : logIndex) (plt : term) (es : list entry) (ci : logIndex) (h : Net.name) (e e' : entry), refined_raft_intermediate_reachable net -> In p (nwPackets net) -> pBody p = AppendEntries t n pli plt es ci -> In e (log (snd (nwState net h))) -> In e' es -> eIndex e = eIndex e' -> eTerm e = eTerm e' -> In e es"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```coq\nintros net p t n pli plt es ci h e e' H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 H6 H7.\nunfold refined_raft_intermediate_reachable, pBody in *.\npose proof (decomposition_1 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ H1 H2) as H8.\npose proof (decomposition_2 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ H1 H2) as H9.\nunfold logs_leaderLogs_interface in *.\nunfold logs_leaderLogs_invariant in *.\nunfold logs_leaderLogs in *.\nunfold ghost_log in *.\nunfold getGhostLogs in *.\nunfold committed in *.\nunfold deghost in *.\nunfold getEntries in *.\nunfold sorted_entries in *.\nunfold findGtIndex in *.\nunfold findAtIndex in *.\nunfold maxIndex in *.\nunfold leaderLogs in *.\nunfold lifted in *.\nunfold logs_term in *.\nunfold prefix_within_term in *.\nunfold prefix_within_term_nw in *.\nunfold prefix_within_term_nw_host in *.\nunfold terms in *.\nunfold log_matching_holds in *.\nunfold log_matching in *.\nunfold ghost_log in *.\nunfold em in *.\nunfold msg_refined_pred in *.\nunfold msg_refined_net_pred in *.\nunfold NW in *.\nunfold raft_ghost_params in *.\nunfold raft_refined_base_params in *.\nunfold raft_refined_multi_params in *.\nunfold doGenericServer in *.\nunfold handleAppendEntries in *.\nunfold handleAppendEntriesReply_true_parametric in *.\nunfold commit_recorded in *.\nunfold handleClientRequest in *.\nunfold handleTimeout in *.\nunfold handleInput in *.\nunfold tryToBecomeLeader in *.\nunfold recvHandler in *.\nunfold raft_net_in in *.\nunfold ghost_log in *.\nunfold lifted in *.\nunfold doLeader in *.\nunfold handleClientRequest in *.\nunfold doGenericServer in *.\nunfold handleTimeout in *.\nunfold doFollower in *.\nunfold recvHandler in *.\nunfold handleInput in *.\nunfold msg_refined_net in *.\nunfold MSG in *.\nunfold MSG_pred in *.\nunfold ghost_log in *.\nunfold specific_ghost_log in *.\nunfold handler in *.\nunfold ensure_leaderLogs_term in *.\nunfold ensure_leaderLogs_contiguous_host in *.\nunfold get_currentTerm in *.\nunfold update_election_timeout in *.\nunfold refined_raft_intermediate_reachable in *.\nunfold deghost_host in *.\nunfold lifted_host in *.\nunfold ghost_data in *.\nunfold log_matching in *.\nunfold specific_append_entries in *.\nunfold R_ in *.\nunfold no_entries_past_current_term in *.\nunfold entries_contiguous_nw_host in *.\nunfold prevLog_in_host in *.\nunfold append_entries_sane_h in *.\nunfold lift_prop in *.\nunfold inputs_match in *.\nunfold lift_prop in *.\nunfold leaderLogs_sorted in *.\nunfold lift_prop in *.\nunfold lift in *.\nunfold refuse_new_hosts in *.\ndestruct H8 as [H8 | H8];
