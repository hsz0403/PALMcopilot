Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.```\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nX: Type\nq: X -> bool\np: X -> bool\nA: list X\n\nGoal:\nfilter p (filter q A) = filter q (filter p A)\n\nPremises:\nInductive list (A : Type) : Type := nil : list A | cons : A -> list A -> list A Arguments list _%type_scope Arguments nil {A}%type_scope Arguments cons {A}%type_scope a l%list_scope : rename\nfilter : forall A : Type, (A -> bool) -> list A -> list A\nfilter_and : forall p q A, filter p (filter q A) = filter (fun x => p x && q x) A\nfilter_pq_eq : forall p q A, (forall x, x el A -> p x = q x) -> filter p A = filter q A\nfilter_pq_mono : forall p q A, (forall x, x el A -> p x -> q x) -> filter p A <<= filter q A\nmap_ext_in_iff : map ?f ?l = map ?g ?l < -> (forall a : ?A, a el ?l -> ?f a = ?g a) where ?A : [X : Type p : X -> bool q : X -> bool A : list X |- Type] ?B : [X : Type p : X -> bool q : X -> bool A : list X |- Type] ?f : [X : Type p : X -> bool q : X -> bool A : list X |- ?A -> ?B] ?g : [X : Type p : X -> bool q : X -> bool A : list X |- ?A -> ?B] ?l : [X : Type p : X -> bool q : X -> bool A : list X |- list ?A]\nVectorSpec.to_list_of_list_opp : forall l : list ?A, VectorDef.to_list (VectorDef.of_list l) = l where ?A : [X : Type p : X -> bool q : X -> bool A : list X |- Type]\nfilter_fst' : forall p x A, ~ p x -> filter p (x :: A) = filter p A\nVectorDef.of_list : forall l : list ?A, VectorDef.t ?A (| l |) where ?A : [X : Type p : X -> bool q : X -> bool A : list X |- Type]\nfilter_fst : forall p x A, p x -> filter p (x :: A) = x :: filter p A\nfilter_app : forall p A B, filter p (A ++ B) = filter p A ++ filter p B\nfilter_mono : forall p A B, A <<= B -> filter p A <<= filter p B\nfilter_id : forall p A, (forall x, x el A -> p x) -> filter p A = A\nPos.add_succ_l : forall p q : positive, (Pos.succ p + q)%positive = Pos.succ (p + q)\nconcat_filter_map : forall (A : Type) (f : A -> bool) (l : list (list A)), concat (map (filter f) l) = filter f (concat l)\nPos.add_comm : forall p q : positive, (p + q)%positive = (q + p)%positive\nfilter_incl : forall p A, filter p A <<= A\nin_filter_iff : forall x p A, x el filter p A < -> x el A /\\ p x\nNoDup_filter : forall (A : Type) (f : A -> bool) (l : list A), NoDup l -> NoDup (filter f l)\nList.filter_app : forall (A : Type) (f : A -> bool) (l l' : list A), filter f (l ++ l') = filter f l ++ filter f l'\npositive_ind : forall P : positive -> Prop, (forall p : positive, P p -> P (p~1)%positive) -> (forall p : positive, P p -> P (p~0)%positive) -> P 1%positive -> forall p : positive, P p\nfilter_ext : forall (A : Type) (f g : A -> bool), (forall a : A, f a = g a) -> forall l : list A, filter f l = filter g l\nPos.peano_ind : forall P : positive -> Prop, P 1%positive -> (forall p : positive, P p -> P (Pos.succ p)) -> forall p : positive, P p\nfilter_ext_in : forall (A : Type) (f g : A -> bool) (l : list A), (forall a : A, a el l -> f a = g a) -> filter f l = filter g l\next_in_filter : forall (A : Type) (f g : A -> bool) (l : list A), filter f l = filter g l -> forall a : A, a el l -> f a = g a\nfilter_map : forall (A : Type) (f g : A -> bool) (l : list A), filter f l = filter g l < -> map f l = map g l\nfilter_ext_in_iff : forall (A : Type) (f g : A -> bool) (l : list A), filter f l = filter g l < -> (forall a : A, a el l -> f a = g a)\nPos.add_1_l : forall p : positive, (1 + p)%positive = Pos.succ p\ndec = fun X : Prop => {X} + {~ X} : Prop -> Type Arguments dec _%type_scope\nlist_eq_dec : forall X : Type, eq_dec X -> eq_dec list X\nfilter_In : forall (A : Type) (f : A -> bool) (x : A) (l : list A), x el filter f l < -> x el l /\\ f x = true\nminus_plus_simpl_l_reverse : forall n m p : nat, n -
