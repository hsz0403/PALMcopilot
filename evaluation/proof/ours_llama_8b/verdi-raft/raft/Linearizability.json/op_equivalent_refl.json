[{"history": {"proof": "shelve.", "repairs": [""], "exceptions": []}, "chat": [{"role": "user", "content": "I will give you a Coq proof state, including both hypotheses and a specific goal and your need to prove it. Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.```\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nK: Type\nK_eq_dec: forall x y : K, {x = y} + {x <> y}\n\nGoal:\nforall xs : list op, op_equivalent xs xs\n\nPremises:\nInductive op_equivalent : list op -> list op -> Prop := op_equiv_nil : op_equivalent [] [] | op_equiv_cons : forall (x : op) (xs ys : list op), op_equivalent xs ys -> op_equivalent (x :: xs) (x :: ys) | op_equiv_move : forall (x y : op) (xs ys : list op), good_op_move x y -> op_equivalent xs ys -> op_equivalent (x :: y :: xs) (y :: x :: ys) | op_equiv_trans : forall l1 l2 l3 : list op, op_equivalent l1 l2 -> op_equivalent l2 l3 -> op_equivalent l1 l3 Arguments op_equivalent (_ _)%list_scope Arguments op_equiv_cons _ (_ _)%list_scope Arguments op_equiv_move _ _ (_ _)%list_scope Arguments op_equiv_trans (_ _ _)%list_scope\nInductive list (A : Type) : Type := nil : list A | cons : A -> list A -> list A Arguments list _%type_scope Arguments nil {A}%type_scope Arguments cons {A}%type_scope a l%list_scope : rename\nInductive op : Type := I : K -> op | O : K -> op\nop_equiv_ack_op_rl : forall xs ys : list op, op_equivalent xs ys -> forall k : K, acknowledged_op k ys -> acknowledged_op k xs\nop_equiv_ack_op_lr : forall xs ys : list op, op_equivalent xs ys -> forall k : K, acknowledged_op k xs -> acknowledged_op k ys\nop_equiv_Permutation : forall xs ys : list op, op_equivalent xs ys -> Permutation xs ys\nop_equiv_AAOF_IR_equiv : forall xs ys : list op, op_equivalent xs ys -> forall l : list IR, IR_equivalent (acknowledge_all_ops_func xs l) (acknowledge_all_ops_func ys l)\ndedup_NoDup_id : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (xs : list A), NoDup xs -> dedup A_eq_dec xs = xs\nremove_not_in : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), ~ In x xs -> remove A_eq_dec x xs = xs\nsubset_length : forall A : Type, (forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) -> forall xs ys : list A, NoDup xs -> (forall x : A, In x xs -> In x ys) -> length ys >= length xs\nremove_length_in : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), In x xs -> NoDup xs -> S (length (remove A_eq_dec x xs)) = length xs\nremove_all_app_r : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (xs ys zs : list A), remove_all A_eq_dec xs (ys ++ zs) = remove_all A_eq_dec xs ys ++ remove_all A_eq_dec xs zs\nremove_length_not_in : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), ~ In x xs -> length (remove A_eq_dec x xs) = length xs\ndedup_not_in_cons : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), ~ In x xs -> x :: dedup A_eq_dec xs = dedup A_eq_dec (x :: xs)\nremove_length_ge : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), NoDup xs -> length (remove A_eq_dec x xs) >= length xs -
