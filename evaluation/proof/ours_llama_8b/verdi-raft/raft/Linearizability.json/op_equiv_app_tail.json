[{"history": {"proof": "shelve.", "repairs": [""], "exceptions": []}, "chat": [{"role": "user", "content": "I will give you a Coq proof state, including both hypotheses and a specific goal and your need to prove it. Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.```\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample
