Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.```\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\ns: Rlist\n\nGoal:\nseq2Rlist (Rlist2seq s) = s\n\nPremises:\nRlist2seq = fix Rlist2seq (s : Rlist) : seq R := match s with | nil => [::] | cons h t => h :: Rlist2seq t end : Rlist -> seq R\nseq2Rlist = fix seq2Rlist (s : seq R) : Rlist := match s with | [::] => nil | h :: t => cons h (seq2Rlist t) end : seq R -> Rlist Argument scope is [seq_scope]\nInductive Rlist : Set := nil : Rlist | cons : R -> Rlist -> Rlist For cons: Argument scopes are [R_scope _]\nRtail = fun l : Rlist => match l with | nil => nil | cons _ l' => l' end : Rlist -> Rlist\ncons_Rlist = fix cons_Rlist (l k : Rlist) {struct l} : Rlist := match l with | nil => k | cons a l' => cons a (cons_Rlist l' k) end : Rlist -> Rlist -> Rlist\ncons_ORlist = fix cons_ORlist (k l : Rlist) {struct k} : Rlist := match k with | nil => l | cons a k' => cons_ORlist k' (insert l a) end : Rlist -> Rlist -> Rlist\nordered_Rlist = fun l : Rlist => forall i : nat, (i < Init.Nat.pred (Rlength l))%nat -> pos_Rl l i <= pos_Rl l (S i) : Rlist -> Prop\nmid_Rlist = fix mid_Rlist (l : Rlist) (x : R) {struct l} : Rlist := match l with | nil => nil | cons a l' => cons ((x + a) / 2) (mid_Rlist l' a) end : Rlist -> R -> Rlist Argument scopes are [_ R_scope]\nAbsList = fix AbsList (l : Rlist) (x : R) {struct l} : Rlist := match l with | nil => nil | cons a l' => cons (Rabs (a -
