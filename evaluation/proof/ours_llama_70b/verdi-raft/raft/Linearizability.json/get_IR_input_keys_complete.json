Your response should be a singular code block of Coq proof starting with \"```coq\n\", ending with \"Qed.```\", without any additional explanation or commentary. Follow to these guidelines:\nIntroduce variables using unique names to avoid any conflicts.\nKeep each command distinct and separated, avoid concatenations like ';' or '[cmd|cmd]'.\nOrganize your proof with bullets like '-', '+', and '*' instead of braces ({, }). Shift to their double symbols like '--' and '++', when necessary.\nEffectively use given premises, follow the syntax and structure demonstrated in the examples provided.\n\nExample 1:\n\nHypotheses:\nn, m: nat\nIHn: m + n = n + m\n\nGoal:\nm + S n = S n + m\n\nProof:\n```coq\nsimpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nExample 2:\nHypotheses:\n\nGoal:\nforall n m : nat, m + n = n + m\n\n```coq\nintros n m. induction n.\n- simpl. auto.\n- simpl. rewrite <- IHn. auto.\nQed.```\n\nSolve This Proof State:\n\nHypotheses:\nK: Type\nK_eq_dec: forall x y : K, {x = y} + {x <> y}\n\nGoal:\nforall (xs : list IR) (k : K), In (IRI k) xs -> In k (get_IR_input_keys xs)\n\nPremises:\nInductive IR : Type := IRI : K -> IR | IRO : K -> IR | IRU : K -> IR\nget_IR_input_keys = fun l : list IR => filterMap (fun x : IR => match x with | IRI k => Some k | _ => None end) l : list IR -> list K Arguments get_IR_input_keys _%list_scope\nInductive list (A : Type) : Type := nil : list A | cons : A -> list A -> list A Arguments list _%type_scope Arguments nil {A}%type_scope Arguments cons {A}%type_scope a l%list_scope : rename\nIn : forall A : Type, A -> list A -> Prop\nget_IR_output_keys_complete_O : forall (xs : list IR) (k : K), In (IRO k) xs -> In k (get_IR_output_keys xs)\nget_IR_output_keys_complete_U : forall (xs : list IR) (k : K), In (IRU k) xs -> In k (get_IR_output_keys xs)\nIR_equivalent_all_Is_I : forall (l : list IR) (k : K), (forall x : IR, In x l -> exists k0 : K, x = IRI k0) -> IR_equivalent (l ++ [IRI k]) (IRI k :: l)\nacknowledge_all_ops_func_IRU_In : forall (l : list op) (ir : list IR) (k : K), In (IRU k) (acknowledge_all_ops_func l ir) -> In (I k) l\nIR_equiv_AAOF_II_neq : forall (xs ys : list op) (target : list IR) (k k' : K), k <> k' -> op_equivalent xs ys -> IR_equivalent (acknowledge_all_ops_func xs target) (acknowledge_all_ops_func ys target) -> IR_equivalent (acknowledge_all_ops_func (I k :: I k' :: xs) target) (acknowledge_all_ops_func (I k' :: I k :: ys) target)\nin_dedup_was_in : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (xs : list A) (x : A), In x (dedup A_eq_dec xs) -> In x xs\ndedup_In : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), In x xs -> In x (dedup A_eq_dec xs)\nremove_length_not_in : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), ~ In x xs -> length (remove A_eq_dec x xs) = length xs\nremove_preserve : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x y : A) (xs : list A), x <> y -> In y xs -> In y (remove A_eq_dec x xs)\nin_remove : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x y : A) (xs : list A), In y (remove A_eq_dec x xs) -> In y xs\ngood_trace_IRI_in : forall ir : list IR, good_trace ir -> forall k : K, In (IRI k) ir -> In (IRO k) ir \\/ In (IRU k) ir\nacknowledge_all_ops_was_in : forall (l : list op) (ir : list IR), acknowledge_all_ops l ir -> forall k : K, In (IRI k) ir -> In (I k) l\nremove_not_in : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), ~ In x xs -> remove A_eq_dec x xs = xs\nremove_length_in : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), In x xs -> NoDup xs -> S (length (remove A_eq_dec x xs)) = length xs\ndedup_app : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (xs ys : list A), (forall x y : A, In x xs -> In y ys -> x <> y) -> dedup A_eq_dec (xs ++ ys) = dedup A_eq_dec xs ++ dedup A_eq_dec ys\nfilter_except_one : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (f g : A -> bool) (x : A) (xs : list A), (forall y : A, In y xs -> x <> y -> f y = g y) -> g x = false -> filter f (remove A_eq_dec x xs) = filter g xs\nremove_NoDup : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), NoDup xs -> NoDup (remove A_eq_dec x xs)\nremove_length_lt : forall (A : Type) (x : A) (xs : list A) (eq_dec : forall x0 y : A, {x0 = y} + {x0 <> y}), In x xs -> length xs > length (remove eq_dec x xs)\nremove_length_ge : forall (A : Type) (A_eq_dec : forall x y : A, {x = y} + {x <> y}) (x : A) (xs : list A), NoDup xs -> length (remove A_eq_dec x xs) >= length xs -
